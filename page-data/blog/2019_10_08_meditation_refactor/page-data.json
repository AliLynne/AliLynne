Enter useReducer! - haven't used it before - this should be interesting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Refactoring My Meditation App</h2>\n<p>I've wanted to include more testing my projects for awhile now but many of the courses I took either didn't cover testing at all or skimmed over it briefly. I finally took the time to take a React testing course on Udemy and now I'm excited to get to refactoring my favorite project using a Behavior Driven Development approach.</p>\n<p>I recommend the course. It's <a href=\"&#x27;https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tdd/&#x27;\">React - Mastering Test Driven Development</a> by <a href=\"&#x27;https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tdd/#instructor-1&#x27;\">David Joseph Katz</a>. It is a bit old and I had to find some updated docs to get things to work, but the concepts are very sound.</p>\n<h2>What I'm doing different this time</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to stick with exclusively React hooks this time. When I did the first run through I didn't understand hooks very well, and a lot of the documentation still only included Class examples. I'm a lot better with hooks now and they feel cleaner.</li>\n<li>I'm completely ignoring styling for awhile. Part of the reason I want to use a BDD approach is that I can write my tests, create my components, get the functionality working and not be distracted by endless adjustments to margins and padding that would likely change in two days anyway.</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"2019_10_08_meditation_refactor"}}}
